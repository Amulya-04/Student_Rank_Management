# Student_Rank_Management
The main aim of these project is to reduce direct human to human face situations… and to provide people a more modern use of technology. This program gives the necessary people to access their online student (particular)analytical report , result list of all the given member details in the program . We made this program using python version 3.10, MySQL as back end software.


 In this program we connect MySQL and python in the back end and enter the given  needed details of students which is saved in MySQL  such as name , roll number ,date of birth ,class , marks, their Total, Average and Percentage. After we give necessary functions and modules to access the student report details. Now the required details can be accessed by the assessor through online by entering their roll number. If they want to know the overall rank of the class they can press (the required number given for it).


 The main advantages of these online progress report is that we get accurate, error free and faster results and also a bias free checking of marks. Generally, the use of regular paper based result management system takes time as the teachers need to collect the results , manually calculate their marks ,marking them , converting them into grades , input it  into the system and wait until the reports are printed. This system can take many hours to complete this process and also their might be a chance of miscalculation (i.e. error).


Thus due to all this reasons we can conclude the online results management system is the best and easy way to eliminate all these above problems….and make it easy and accessible to all the assessors.
